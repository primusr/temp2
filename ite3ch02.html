      <p class="lead">This course provides a basic understanding of the methods and techniques of developing a simple to moderately complex web site. Using the current standard web page language, students will be instructed on creating and maintaining a simple web site. After the foundation language has been established, the aid of a web editor will be introduced. A second web-based language will be included to further enhance the web sites.</p>

            <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Browse the Web for examples of Web sites that exhibit good Web design.</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Using a screen-capture program, such as the snipping tool in Windows 7.0, capture Web pages from the Web site that show two levels of information. For example,  capture the main page of a Web site and a secondary page. Describe how the layouts for the two pages suit their information types and the needs of their users.</li>
                    <li>Use the graphic tools in a word-processing program or presentation program to include screen callouts with the Web page images you capture. Th e callouts should indicate the unifying characteristics of the pages, such as shared colors, fonts, graphics, and page layout. (A callout is an arrow or line that connects to explanatory text. For example, Microsoft Word includes a  callout tool in its collection of shapes. </li>
                    <li>Indicate the areas of active white space and passive white space. 
                    <li>Describe whether the design of the site is appropriate for the content.</li>

                    <li>Indicate with screen callouts the jarring or distracting inconsistencies of the site, such as abrupt changes in any design elements, including theme and layout. </li>
                    <li> List detailed recommendations for improving the site design.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                  <li>Write a short essay critiquing a Web site's design. Describe the structural layout of the site and determine whether information is presented clearly and is easily accessible.</li>
                  <br>
                  <li>Browse the Web for sites that use unique navigation methods. Write a short essay describing why the method is or is not successful, or prepare a short slide presentation that you can present to your class.</li>

                    <li>Using scissors, cut out the main elements of each page. Rearrange the elements and paste them in a design you believe improves the site.</li>
                    <li>Compare and contrast the original with your improved design.</li>
                    </ul>
                  <br>
                  <li>Test cross-browser compatibility.</li>
                    <ul>  
                    <li>Make sure you have recent versions of at least two  current browsers installed on your computer.</li>
                    <li>Browse a variety of Web sites. Make sure to view various pages of the sites in the different browsers.</li>
                    <li>Write a detailed description of how the various sites appear in the browsers you have chosen. Look for text, layout, and graphic inconsistencies</li>
